Actually there is no technical thing to talk about. This is very simple **open redirect issue** on very important website of **US Government.**

**iqClickTrk.aspx** has a parameter called redirect that gets the URL and directly redirect to it without checking the URL.

**PoC** : [https://outreach.senate.gov/iqextranet/iqClickTrk.aspx?redirect=https://mustafakemalcan.com](https://outreach.senate.gov/iqextranet/iqClickTrk.aspx?redirect=https://mustafakemalcan.com)

I tried to communicate with the webmaster(?) but he/she doesn't give any kind of response to me. **Webmaster didn't patch** the issue though.

02.07.2019 - I sent the first email but got no response.

02.16.2019 - I sent the second email but got no response.

02.26.2019 - I sent the third email but still got no response.

04.09.2019 - Disclosure date.
