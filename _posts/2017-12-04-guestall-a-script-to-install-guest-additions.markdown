Hi everyone. I codedÂ a basic **python script** that install guest additions on your debian based linux. I called it **Guestall**, it supports **VMWare** and **VirtualBox.** It is easy to use.

I've made it because I always forget these things. It is not a problem anymore with guestall. I hope it helps everyone like me.
