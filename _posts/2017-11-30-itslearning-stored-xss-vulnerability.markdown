I've found an **stored XSS** on **[itslearning](https://itslearning.com/global/)** education system works without even autorized. Hacker can do lots of things via Itslearning stored XSS vulnerability. This **XSS** works without any authorization, so it is more dangerous than usual XSS.

**Payload** : I use <svg/onload=prompt(1)> but almost every payload works.

28 November 2017 - I've sent details about itslearning stored [XSS vulnerability](https://mustafakemalcan.com/smartsheet-xss-via-file-upload/).

30 November 2017 - Itslearning security team explanation ; "1. We allow any kind of content on files.itslearning.com, unaltered.

2\. The modifications that you experience are there to try to help the user building rich content using our editor and not to prevent XSS."

System stays vulnerable to all kind of phishing attack or not? You decide.

UPDATE :

January 2018 - Itslearning considered it as a vulnerability and fixed completely.
