Hi everyone in this post I'll show you how I find out **[First Touch Games](http://www.firsttouchgames.com) database information**. It is actually happens because of a common mistake. Let's see.

**FTS** is a **populer football game** which is available on Android and iOS platforms. I dont know why but they are still using very old version of **Wordpress** regularly. I used **WpScan** tool in **kali linux**. Actually this vulnerability revealed too easy to me. But I want to let you know.

In my opinion they forgot this file when they are in upgrading their website. But **wp-config** is crucial file that no one should see. I hope they will remove it and won't do that again.

Here is the proof of file. I blurred all of the valuable informations.
