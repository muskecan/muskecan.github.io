**Hello world!** Just kidding I dont like cliches at all. I am **Mustafa Kemal Can** ( muskecan ) and this is my first post. I'll use this place as a blog, diary and place that I can speak. Let's talk about me.

## Who am I? - Mustafa Kemal Can - muskecan

[![mustafa kemal can muskecan](images/who-am-i.jpg "mustafa kemal can muskecan 2")](http://mustafakemalcan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/who-am-i.jpg) I dont take you too much, just want to say that cyber security was a hobby for me even I was a kid. Whole story of my career has started 2009, when I was 13. Someone hacked my game account and I started to think "how". After that I learned **RAT**s,**undetecting** etc. In **cyber security** once you jump in the road, you can't leave it. My main branch is web application security, but I have knowledge about reverse engineering, undetecting, linux and windows security too.

In this years, Iâ€™ve seen lots of things and people. I dont write all of them of course but maybe I'll do it later ;) Welcome again. Take care!
